# TikTok Tracker Blocks â€” Magisk Module

A simple Magisk module to block TikTok tracking domains on Android devices.

## Description

This module adds entries to your device's hosts file to block numerous TikTok tracking domains. It prevents TikTok from collecting your activity data and fingerprinting your device while still allowing the app to function for normal use.

## Features

- Blocks hundreds of TikTok tracking and fingerprinting domains
- Simple installation via Magisk Manager

## Requirements

- Android device with [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) installed
- Magisk Manager app

## Installation

1. Download the latest module ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/Scott-Nx/TikTok-Tracker-Blocks_Magisk/releases) page
2. Open Magisk Manager
3. Tap on Modules > Install from storage
4. Select the downloaded ZIP file
5. Reboot your device

## How It Works

The module overlays the system hosts file to redirect tracking domain requests to `0.0.0.0`, effectively blocking the connection. This prevents TikTok from sending your usage data to their tracking servers.
